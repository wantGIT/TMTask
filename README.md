This project is using the reddit JSON data to display the reddit posts in a different way.
This is simply uses **HTML CSS** and **Javascript** for the webpage.

For a limited time, I am hosting this at jamesyao.co.uk . If the site is not up then it is probably due to my dynamic IP changing as I am just doing this from my home computer on *apache2*.
